# SecondYear
This is a GUI project.

For the first part of the second year, we worked with GUI. Even though there are environments that allow programmer to create graphic interfaces without having to write the whole code, the idea here was to learn and understand GUI. Therefore, it is a simple interface and all code is my own. Some functionality was missing from original assignment.
It is a system to register and manage patients in a hospital.
